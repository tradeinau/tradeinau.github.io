Introduction<span> </span> In <span> </span> today’s <span> </span> world, <span> </span> f<span> inancial <span> </span> processes <span> </span> are <span> </span> becoming <span> </span> more <span> </span> and <span> </span> more </span> complicated, <span> </span> involving <span> </span> investment <span> </span> funds, <span> </span> a <span> </span> wide <span> </span> range <span> </span> of <span> </span> banking <span> </span> p<span> </span> ro<span> </span> ducts, insurance <span> </span> systems, <span> </span> reforms <span> </span> of <span> </span> pension <span> </span> systems <span> </span> and <span> </span> so <span> </span> on<span> , <span> </span> </span> which <span> </span> creates <span> </span> a <span> </span> pressing need for <span> </span> educators to <span> </span> introduce financia<span> </span> l literacy <span> </span> courses <span> at</span> <span> </span> all levels <span> </span> of modern education.<span> </span> 2 On <span> </span> the <span> </span> one <span> </span> hand, <span> </span> moder<span> </span> n <span> </span> financial <span> </span> services <span> </span> improve our <span> </span> quality <span> </span> of <span> </span> life <span> </span> (bank cards, <span> </span> mobile <span> </span> banking <span> </span> applications, <span> </span> insurance <span> </span> and <span> </span> so <span> </span> on); <span> </span> on <span> </span> the <span> </span> other, <span> </span> people <span> </span> are generally not <span> </span> ready to use <span> </span> these services <span> </span> responsibly because they <span> </span> lack the <span> </span> necessary<span> </span> knowledge and skills. This concerns, first of all, <span> ‘</span> high risk<span> ’</span> groups such as pensioners and <span> </span> children <span> </span> and, secondly, <span> </span> people <span> </span> engaging in <span> </span> destructive <span> </span> (deviant) <span> </span> behaviour, that is, <span> </span> those <span> </span> who <span> </span> are <span> </span> unwilling <span> </span> to <span> </span> delve <span> </span> into <span> </span> f<span> </span> inancial <span> </span> matters <span> </span> or <span> </span> expand <span> </span> the<span> </span> <span> </span> range <span> </span> of financial services and tools with w<span> </span> hich they are familiar. Due to <span> </span> their financial illiteracy <span> </span> and <span> </span> lack <span> </span> of <span> </span> understanding, <span> </span> t<span> </span> hese <span> </span> groups <span> </span> are <span> </span> m<span> </span> ost <span> </span> prone <span> </span> to <span> </span> <span> ‘</span> mob psychology<span> ’</span> <span> and can be susceptible to mass hysteria. </span> Financial <span> </span> illiteracy <span> </span> negatively <span> </span> affects <span> </span> not <span> </span> only <span> </span> <span> people’s</span> <span> </span> personal <span> </span> welfare <span> </span> but also the <span> </span> financial sphere <span> </span> as a <span> </span> whole. For <span> </span> exam<span> </span> ple, s<span> </span> ince people <span> </span> of <span> ‘high</span> <span> -</span> <span> risk’ <span> </span> groups </span> are <span> </span> unable <span> </span> to <span> </span> manage their <span> </span> budgets: <span> </span> they <span> </span> tend <span> </span> to <span> </span> go <span> </span> deep <span> </span> into <span> </span> debt <span> </span> by <span> </span> taking loans. Moreover, <span> </span> being <span> </span> gullible, <span> </span> they <span> </span> fall <span> </span> victims <span> </span> to <span> </span> pyramid <span> </span> schemes <span> </span> and <span> </span> other <span> </span> forms <span> </span> of financial <span> </span> fraud. <span> </span> On <span> </span> the <span> </span> global <span> </span> scale, <span> </span> such <span> </span> behaviour <span> </span> can <span> </span> contribute <span> </span> to <span> </span> the <span> </span> country<span> ’</span> <span> s </span> economy <span> </span> falling into <span> </span> a <span> </span> recession, <span> </span> <span> as</span> happened <span> </span> when <span> </span> the housing <span> </span> bubble <span> </span> burst in <span> </span> the US. Therefore, <span> </span> enhancement <span> </span> of <span> </span> the general <span> </span> population<span> ’</span> s f<span> </span> inancial <span> </span> literacy <span> </span> would have a profound impact on the nation’s f<span> </span> uture financial health.<span> </span> 1.2. Concept of financial literacy<span> </span> The concept of financial literacy can be used in <span> </span> its wider or narrower sense and can <span> </span> be <span> </span> linked <span> </span> to <span> </span> other <span> </span> terms <span> </span> such <span> </span> as <span> </span> financial <span> </span> education, <span> </span> capability, <span> </span> awareness <span> </span> and others. Olga <span> </span> Kuzina explains the <span> </span> differences between these terms, <span> </span> showing how <span> </span> they 3 put <span> </span> em<span> </span> phasis on <span> </span> different aspects <span> </span> of financial <span> </span> literacy (<span> </span> Kuz<span> </span> ina 2005)<span> </span> . Originally, the analysis of these concepts was <span> </span> made by Sandra J.<span> </span> Huston (Huston 2010), who selected <span> </span> <span> 71</span> individual <span> </span> studies drawn <span> </span> from <span> 52</span> <span> </span> different data <span> </span> sets <span> </span> and thus <span> </span> established elements of a <span> </span> financial literacy measure. <span> </span> All the definitions analysed by H<span> </span> uston emphasized <span> </span> that kno<span> </span> wledge <span> </span> and skills <span> </span> (set of <span> </span> competencies) should <span> </span> b<span> </span> elong <span> </span> to the financial sphere. The <span> </span> Organization <span> </span> for <span> </span> Economic <span> </span> Cooperation <span> </span> a<span> </span> nd <span> </span> Development <span> </span> (OECD) defines <span> </span> financial <span> </span> literacy <span> </span> as <span> </span> <span> ‘a <span> </span> combination <span> </span> of <span> </span> awareness, <span> </span> knowledge, <span> </span> skill, <span> </span> attitude </span> and <span> </span> behaviour <span> </span> necessary <span> </span> t<span> </span> o <span> </span> make <span> </span> sound <span> </span> financial <span> </span> decisions <span> </span> and <span> </span> ultimately <span> </span> achieve individual financial well-being<span> ’</span> (OECD 2011, 3). We <span> </span> should also <span> </span> mention <span> </span> the studies <span> </span> of <span> </span> the project <span> </span> <span> ‘The <span> </span> Russia <span> </span> Trust Fund <span> </span> for </span> Financial <span> </span> Literacy <span> </span> Education<span> </span> <span> ’</span> , <span> </span> which <span> </span> measured <span> </span> financial <span> </span> literacy <span> </span> by <span> </span> conducting <span> </span> <span> 74</span> focus <span> </span> group d<span> </span> iscussions <span> </span> in ei<span> </span> ght <span> </span> countries. <span> </span> These discussion<span> </span> s <span> </span> brought to <span> </span> light the<span> </span> qualities <span> </span> that <span> </span> characterize <span> </span> financially <span> </span> capable <span> </span> individuals. <span> </span> These <span> </span> qualities <span> </span> were grouped <span> </span> into <span> </span> several <span> </span> major <span> </span> domains: <span> </span> planning <span> </span> ahead <span> </span> and <span> </span> making <span> </span> provisions <span> </span> for <span> </span> the long term (54%); making choices and being able to prioritize (53%); self-discipline in<span> </span> spending (51%); <span> </span> living within <span> </span> one<span> ’</span> <span> s </span> means <span> </span> (45%); being <span> </span> able to <span> </span> save money <span> </span> even if it means laying by small sum<span> </span> s (31%); and so on (Kempson 2013)<span> . </span> Thus, <span> </span> financial <span> </span> literacy <span> </span> is <span> </span> a <span> </span> set <span> </span> of <span> </span> competencies <span> </span> that <span> </span> enable <span> </span> an <span> </span> individual <span> </span> to take informed and <span> </span> effective decisions <span> </span> in order<span> </span> to improve their welfare <span> </span> and to minimize their time and money losse<span> </span> s. <span> </span> 1.3. International studies of financial lit<span> </span> eracy<span> </span> 4 Recently, <span> </span> there <span> </span> have <span> </span> been <span> </span> a <span> </span> number <span> </span> of <span> </span> large-scale <span> </span> programmes <span> </span> studying <span> </span> the financial literacy of <span> </span> stude<span> </span> nts, such <span> </span> as the projects supported b<span> </span> y<span> </span> the <span> </span> OECD and World Bank. <span> </span> The <span> </span> first <span> </span> studies <span> </span> of <span> </span> financial <span> </span> literacy <span> </span> were <span> </span> conducted <span> </span> before <span> </span> the <span> </span> international programs. <span> </span> These <span> </span> studies, <span> </span> however, <span> </span> mostly <span> </span> focused <span> </span> on <span> </span> money management: <span> </span> for example, <span> </span> Jelly <span> </span> measured <span> </span> the <span> </span> level <span> </span> of <span> </span> financial <span> </span> literacy <span> </span> among <span> </span> <span> 20</span> -year-old <span> </span> s<span> </span> tude<span> </span> nts and <span> </span> found <span> </span> that they<span> </span> <span> </span> were <span> </span> highly <span> </span> aware of <span> </span> budgeting <span> </span> and <span> </span> management <span> </span> of perso<span> </span> nal finance. <span> </span> Similar <span> </span> results <span> </span> were <span> </span> obtained <span> </span> by <span> </span> Furrer <span> </span> (Furrer <span> </span> 1960) <span> </span> and <span> </span> Larson <span> </span> (Larson 1970)<span> . <span> There are o<span> </span> ther studies, however, which demonstrate that university an<span> </span> d </span> </span> school <span> </span> s<span> </span> tudent<span> </span> s <span> </span> have <span> </span> a <span> </span> low <span> </span> level <span> </span> of <span> </span> financial <span> </span> literacy <span> </span> in <span> </span> general <span> </span> or in <span> </span> some <span> </span> of <span> </span> its aspects, such <span> </span> as personal <span> </span> earnings, <span> </span> consumer lending <span> </span> and investment <span> </span> (Langrehr 1979)<span> , <span> (Thompson <span> </span> 1965). As for <span> </span> the earlier fu<span> </span> ndamental research <span> </span> in this <span> </span> sphere, </span> </span> Danes and Hira (Danes<span> , </span> Hira, 1987) estim<span> </span> ated that financial literacy among the population <span> </span> was <span> </span> at <span> </span> the <span> </span> medium <span> </span> level<span> </span> <span> </span> and <span> </span> pointed <span> </span> out <span> </span> the <span> </span> importance <span> </span> of <span> </span> introducing financial <span> </span> literacy <span> </span> as <span> </span> a <span> </span> separate <span> </span> discipline <span> </span> <span> at</span> <span> </span> all <span> </span> levels <span> </span> of <span> </span> education. <span> </span> Similar <span> </span> results were <span> </span> obtained by <span> </span> the <span> </span> series <span> </span> of studies <span> </span> of <span> </span> <span> Jumpstart Coalition <span> </span> (1997, <span> </span> 2000, 2009 <span> </span> гг.) </span> (Jumpstart Coalition 2009)<span> , </span> and by Lusardi A., Mitc<span> </span> hell O. (Lusardi, Mitchell, 2007). These <span> </span> surveys <span> </span> mostly <span> </span> focused <span> </span> on <span> </span> t<span> </span> esting <span> </span> the <span> </span> knowledge <span> </span> of <span> </span> financial terminology, which <span> </span> prevented their <span> </span> authors from <span> </span> making any <span> </span> significant conclusions about how financially literate and com<span> </span> petent their respondents actual<span> </span> ly were. Financial <span> </span> literacy <span> </span> started to <span> </span> be <span> </span> measured <span> </span> on <span> </span> the <span> </span> global <span> </span> scale when <span> </span> the <span> </span> OECD administered <span> </span> a <span> </span> survey <span> </span> of <span> </span> financial <span> </span> literac<span> </span> y <span> </span> among <span> </span> students <span> </span> within <span> </span> the <span> </span> framew<span> </span> ork <span> </span> of their international <span> </span> programme <span> ‘</span> PISA <span> </span> 2012<span> ’</span> (Programme <span> </span> for International Stude<span> </span> nt 5 Assessment) <span> </span> (OECD, <span> </span> 2014). <span> </span> A <span> </span> similar <span> </span> survey <span> </span> has <span> </span> been <span> </span> conducted <span> </span> in R<span> </span> ussia <span> </span> since 2011 <span> </span> <span> by</span> <span> </span> the <span> </span> project <span> </span> <span> ‘</span> Enhancement <span> </span> of <span> </span> Financial <span> </span> Literacy <span> </span> and <span> </span> Development <span> </span> of Financial Education in the <span> </span> Russ<span> </span> ian Federation<span> ’</span> <span> , </span> supported <span> </span> by the Russian Ministry of Finance and with the World Bank. While initially <span> ‘<span> PISA</span> ’</span> surveys focused on the competences of students in mathematics <span> </span> and <span> </span> science, <span> </span> in 2012, <span> </span> a survey<span> </span> <span> </span> of financial <span> </span> su<span> </span> rvey<span> </span> <span> </span> was <span> </span> added. Since then, it has <span> </span> been held once every three <span> </span> years, together with other tests. <span> </span> The first stage of the financial literacy measurement was conducted in 2012 and the second, in 2015. The <span> </span> s<span> </span> tudy<span> </span> <span> </span> assessed <span> </span> the <span> </span> capability <span> </span> of <span> </span> <span> 15</span> -year-olds <span> </span> to <span> </span> find, <span> </span> understand <span> </span> and <span> </span> evaluate relevant <span> </span> information <span> </span> for <span> </span> efficient <span> </span> decision-making <span> </span> and <span> </span> to <span> </span> predict <span> </span> the <span> </span> possible financial <span> </span> consequences <span> </span> of their <span> </span> decisions; <span> </span> to <span> </span> make i<span> </span> nform<span> </span> ed <span> </span> judgements; <span> </span> to <span> </span> m<span> </span> anage their <span> </span> financial resources; <span> </span> to <span> </span> apply their <span> </span> knowledge, <span> </span> skills <span> </span> and values <span> </span> when <span> </span> shopping and <span> </span> in <span> </span> other <span> </span> financial <span> </span> contexts; <span> </span> and <span> </span> to <span> </span> adopt <span> </span> responsible <span> </span> behaviour <span> </span> towards themselves and others, their comm<span> </span> unities and the environment. ‘<span> PISA-2012</span> ’<span> <span> </span> surveyed <span> </span> approximately <span> </span> 29,000 <span> </span> students <span> </span> from <span> </span> <span> 18</span> <span> </span> countries. </span> Shanghai-China scored highest with <span> </span> the mean score of 603; it was <span> </span> followed by Belgium <span> </span> (541), <span> </span> Estonia <span> </span> (529), <span> </span> Australia <span> </span> (526), <span> </span> New <span> </span> Zealand <span> </span> (520), <span> </span> the <span> </span> Czech Republic (513) and Poland <span> </span> (510)<span> </span> (OECD 2014<span> , <span> </span> <span> 15</span> </span> ).

The <span> </span> survey <span> </span> results <span> </span> have <span> </span> shown <span> </span> that <span> </span> students <span> </span> were <span> </span> poorly <span> </span> informed <span> </span> about <span> </span> the pension s<span> </span> y<span> </span> stem <span> </span> and <span> </span> banking <span> </span> products <span> </span> and <span> </span> services <span> </span> (except for <span> </span> mobile banking applications <span> </span> and <span> </span> the <span> </span> electronic wallet), <span> </span> <span> but</span> <span> </span> that <span> </span> they <span> </span> were <span> </span> aware <span> </span> of <span> </span> saving p<span> </span> ractices and consumer rights protection<span> . </span> On <span> </span> average, <span> </span> at <span> </span> the <span> </span> pre-test, <span> </span> 35% <span> </span> of <span> </span> students answered <span> </span> the <span> </span> questions <span> </span> correctly and <span> in</span> <span> </span> the follow-up <span> </span> tests, 63%. <span> </span> The results <span> </span> of the <span> </span> first stage <span> </span> have demonstrated <span> </span> that 7.5% <span> </span> of <span> </span> students <span> </span> (19 out <span> </span> of <span> </span> 252) <span> </span> could <span> </span> not <span> </span> give accurate <span> </span> answers <span> </span> to <span> </span> more <span> </span> than <span> </span> two questions, while, <span> at</span> <span> </span> the third stage results, this number dropped to<span> </span> 3% (7 students our of 252). Our <span> </span> experience <span> </span> of <span> </span> conducting <span> </span> lectures <span> </span> on <span> </span> financial <span> </span> literacy <span> </span> has <span> </span> allowed <span> </span> us <span> </span> to draw <span> </span> conclusions <span> </span> and elaborate <span> </span> guidelines <span> </span> for <span> </span> enhancing <span> </span> financial literacy <span> </span> of <span> </span> senior school students<span> . </span> During the <span> </span> lectures, students e<span> </span> ngaged actively<span> </span> with <span> </span> the material <span> </span> and asked questions about the Russian pension system. They were parti<span> </span> cularly<span> </span> interested in how their future pension is formed and how its amount varies depending on different ty<span> </span> pes 23<span> </span> of income. Other <span> </span> topics that aroused a l<span> </span> ot of their interest <span> </span> were plastic card fraud and ways of investment, about which students had only<span> </span> a vague idea.<span> </span> At the <span> </span> second lecture, <span> </span> the lecturer <span> </span> spoke about <span> </span> loan agreements and<span> </span> protection of consumer rights. Students had a chance to a<span> </span> sk the invited legal practitioners questions <span> </span> that <span> </span> referred <span> </span> to<span> </span> <span> </span> their <span> </span> individual <span> </span> experience <span> </span> about <span> </span> how <span> </span> they <span> </span> could <span> </span> protect their interests in cases of their violation. Th<span> us<span> , <span> </span> it <span> </span> can <span> </span> be <span> </span> concluded <span> </span> that <span> </span> students <span> </span> lack <span> </span> financial <span> </span> knowledge <span> </span> and are <span> </span> in </span> </span> need <span> </span> of <span> </span> communication <span> </span> with <span> </span> experts <span> </span> in <span> </span> this <span> </span> field. <span> </span> We <span> </span> believe <span> </span> that <span> </span> such communication <span> </span> can <span> </span> be <span> </span> organized <span> </span> in <span> </span> the <span> </span> form <span> </span> of <span> </span> optional <span> </span> regular <span> </span> lectures. <span> </span> It <span> </span> is <span> </span> also important <span> </span> that <span> </span> such <span> </span> lectures <span> </span> should <span> </span> focus <span> </span> on <span> </span> practical <span> </span> matters, <span> </span> in <span> </span> particular, instructing <span> </span> students how <span> to</span> <span> </span> understand a<span> </span> nd evaluate <span> </span> the information ne<span> </span> cessary <span> </span> to make sensible <span> </span> decisi<span> </span> ons and <span> </span> how to predict <span> </span> possible consequences of such <span> </span> decisions. Students <span> </span> should also <span> </span> be <span> </span> taught how <span> </span> to <span> </span> make <span> </span> inform<span> </span> ed <span> </span> judgements and <span> </span> manage <span> </span> their financial <span> </span> resources; <span> </span> how to <span> </span> apply <span> </span> their <span> </span> knowledge, skills <span> </span> and <span> </span> values <span> </span> when <span> </span> shopping and <span> </span> in <span> </span> other financi<span> </span> al <span> </span> contexts; and <span> </span> how <span> </span> to take <span> </span> responsible decisions <span> </span> which <span> </span> will affect their lives, the lives of other people, <span> </span> their communities and the environm<span> </span> ent. It <span> </span> is <span> </span> also <span> </span> essent<span> </span> ial <span> </span> to <span> </span> raise <span> </span> financ<span> </span> ial <span> </span> literacy <span> </span> among secondary <span> </span> school <span> </span> students of junior grades up to and including the 8<span> </span> <span> th</span> grade. This could be done, for example, in the form of lectures conducted once a m<span> </span> onth or once every two months. For <span> </span> senior <span> </span> students of <span> </span> secondary <span> </span> schools <span> </span> and <span> </span> first- <span> </span> or <span> </span> second-y<span> </span> ear <span> </span> students <span> </span> of vocational schools, such lectures <span> </span> should be conducted more frequently. Students should be <span> </span> given more <span> </span> opportunities <span> of</span> real-life <span> </span> contact with financial <span> </span> experts such as bankers, company managers, legal prac<span> </span> titioners and so on. 24<span> </span> As <span> </span> practice <span> </span> has <span> </span> shown, <span> </span> instead <span> </span> of <span> </span> the <span> </span> traditional <span> </span> lecture <span> </span> format, <span> </span> the <span> </span> engaged lecture format is more <span> </span> suitable for this <span> </span> target group because <span> </span> students are more interested <span> </span> in practical <span> </span> questions associated <span> </span> with managing <span> </span> their <span> </span> personal finan<span> </span> cial resources rather than in theoretical m<span> </span> atters. As for university students<span> , </span> they should be taught the theoretical basics of financial <span> </span> literacy <span> </span> (in <span> </span> particular <span> </span> students <span> </span> maj<span> </span> oring <span> </span> in <span> </span> engi<span> </span> neering <span> </span> and <span> </span> natural sciences): such <span> </span> courses must cover <span> </span> not only management <span> </span> of personal budget <span> </span> but also financial processes in <span> the</span> public and private sectors.

Chau Nguyen</span> </span> <span> This study analyzes the relationship between high school students’ scores on a test of personal financial literacy and their state&#x27;s personal finance curriculum mandate. At the time of the testing, twenty of the thirty-one states included in the study had some kind of educational policy in the area of personal financial management. The results of the study show that curriculum mandates, broadly defined, are not generally associated with higher students’ scores. However, students in states that required specific financial education course work scored significantly higher than those in states with either a general mandate or with no mandate.</span> <span> View</span> <span> <span> Show abstract</span> </span> Financial literacy and financial capability: Definitions, measurement methods, and analysis in the case of Russia <span> Article</span> <span> Aug 2015</span> <span> <span> </span> <span> Olga Kuzina</span> </span> <span> The main purpose of the study is to assess the level of financial capability of Russians by using the methodology of cross country comparison developed by the Russia Financial Literacy and Education Trust Fund. The paper gives a brief description of the methodology of financial literacy and financial capability measurements, as well as the results of the survey in Russia. From the analysis of the survey data, it is concluded that the weak areas of the financial capability of Russians concern issues related to planning of expenses and keeping these plans completed, creating reserves to pay for major planned or unexpected expenditures, lack of control over money spent using written records of incomes and expenses, developing regular saving habits, and lengthening time horizons.</span> <span> View</span> <span> <span> Show abstract</span> </span> State Mandated Financial Education and the Credit Behavior of Young Adults <span> Article</span> <span> Jan 2014</span> <span> <span> Alexandra Brown</span> </span> <span> <span> J.

Schmeiser</span> </span> <span> <span> </span> <span> Carly Urban</span> </span> <span> In the U.S., a number of states have mandated personal finance classes in public school curricula to address perceived deficiencies in financial decision-making competency. Despite the growth of financial and economic education provided in public schools, little is known about the effect of these programs on the credit behaviors of young adults. Using a panel of credit report data, we examine young adults in three states where personal financial education mandates were implemented in 2007: Georgia, Idaho, and Texas. We compare the credit scores and delinquency rates of young adults in each of these states pre- and post-implementation of the education to those of students in a synthetic control state and then bordering states without financial education. We find that young people who are in school after the implementation of a financial education requirement have higher relative credit scores and lower relative delinquency rates than those in control states.</span> <span> View</span> <span> <span> Show abstract</span> </span> PISA 2012 Assessment and Analytical Framework: Mathematics, Reading, Science, Problem Solving and Financial Literacy <span> Book</span> <span> Jan 2010</span> <span> <span> OECD</span> </span> <span> View</span> Money Management Knowledge of College Students <span> Article</span> <span> Jan 1987</span> <span> <span> Sharon M.

However, almost all previous research has found no difference in consumer economic competency between students who had taken a consumer education/economics course and students who had not taken the course. This research was conducted in a state that requires consumer education of all students to see if there was a change in competency level and attitudes toward business. Potential differences in types of courses used to meet the state requirements were also investigated. The basic finding is that students who took a course specifically designed to present consumer education topics did improve their consumer economics competency and developed a more positive attitude toward business.</span> <span> View</span> <span> <span> Show abstract</span> </span> A comparison of personal finance understandings of high school students [microform] / <span> Article</span> <span> <span> Larson</span> </span> <span> <span> Evelyn Ruth</span> </span> <span> Thesis (Ph.

It allows us to evaluate financial knowledge during workers’ prime earning years when they are making key financial decisions, and it offers detailed financial literacy and retirement planning questions, permitting a finer assessment of respondents’ financial literacy than heretofore feasible. We can also compare respondents’ selfassessed financial knowledge levels with objective measures of financial literacy, and most valuably, we can investigate prior financial training which permits us to identify key causal links. By every measure, and in every sample we examine, financial literacy proves to be a key determinant of retirement planning. We also find that respondent literacy is higher when they were exposed to economics in school and to company-based financial education programs.</span> <span> View</span> <span> <span> Show abstract</span> </span> Education and Saving: The Long-Term Effects of High School Financial Curriculum Mandates <span> Article</span> <span> Jun 2001</span> <span> J PUBLIC ECON </span> <span> <span> B.

While some datasets are available, the nature of migration complicates their scientific use. Virtually no existing dataset captures international migration trajectories. To alleviate these difficulties, we suggest: (i) the international coordination of data collection methodologies and standardization of immigrant identifiers; (ii) a longitudinal approach to data collection; (iii) the inclusion of adequate information about relevant characteristics of migrants, including retrospective information, in surveys; (iv) minimal anonymization; (v) immigrant boosters in existing surveys; (vi) the use of modern technologies and facilitation of data service centers; and (vii) making data access a priority of data collection.</span> <span> View</span> <span> <span> Show abstract</span> </span> <span> Show more</span> Advertisement <h2> Recommendations</h2> Discover more <span> Project</span> <h3> FINANCIAL LITERACY </h3> <span> <span> </span> <span> Anastasiya Sudakova</span> </span> View project <span> Article</span> <h3> Financial literacy: Theoretical interpretation and empirical research </h3> <span> July 2017</span> <span> <span> A.E.
