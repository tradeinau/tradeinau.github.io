Whether your child or student is in elementary school or in their late teens, teaching them about finances can set them up for success later in life. Start by teaching them about budgeting and managing expenses. Explain how credit works, why it’s important, and how to use credit cards responsibly. Stress the importance of saving, and introduce the basic ways to invest money. Since money management can be abstract and complex, use apps and other resources to simulate concrete real-world scenarios. </p> <h2> <span> Steps</span> </h2> <h3> Part <span> 1</span> <span> of 3:</span> <span> Introducing Budget Management</span> </h3> <span> {"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/c\/cd\/Teach-Financial-Literacy-Step-1.jpg\/v4-460px-Teach-Financial-Literacy-Step-1.jpg","bigUrl":"\/images\/thumb\/c\/cd\/Teach-Financial-Literacy-Step-1.jpg\/aid9668898-v4-728px-Teach-Financial-Literacy-Step-1.jpg","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":345,"bigWidth":"728","bigHeight":"546","licensing":" div class=\"mw-parser-output\" p License: a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/\" Creative Commons \/a br \n \/p p br \/ \n \/p \/div "}</span> 1 <b> Explain how to accurately estimate income and expenses.</b> Make a spreadsheet or write a sample monthly budget with a pen and paper.

[1] <span> <span> X</span> <span> Research source</span> <span> </span> </span> Mention that income and expenses can fluctuate month to month, so tracking them over time is important. <span> {"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/3\/3a\/Teach-Financial-Literacy-Step-2.jpg\/v4-460px-Teach-Financial-Literacy-Step-2.jpg","bigUrl":"\/images\/thumb\/3\/3a\/Teach-Financial-Literacy-Step-2.jpg\/aid9668898-v4-728px-Teach-Financial-Literacy-Step-2.jpg","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":345,"bigWidth":"728","bigHeight":"546","licensing":" div class=\"mw-parser-output\" p License: a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/\" Creative Commons \/a br \n \/p p br \/ \n \/p \/div "}</span> 2 <b> Make the sample budget relevant for your student or child.</b> For instance, include your teenager’s actual income and spending from last month. List after-tax income from their part-time job and add up their car insurance, cell phone bill, clothes, haircut, and money spent going out with friends. [2] <span> <span> X</span> <span> Research source</span> <span> </span> </span> Start with these basic examples, then introduce a more complex sample budget that includes rent, utilities, and groceries. For younger students, use simple values, such as a $10 weekly allowance and candy, toys, and other small expenses. <span> {"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/1\/10\/Teach-Financial-Literacy-Step-3.jpg\/v4-460px-Teach-Financial-Literacy-Step-3.jpg","bigUrl":"\/images\/thumb\/1\/10\/Teach-Financial-Literacy-Step-3.jpg\/aid9668898-v4-728px-Teach-Financial-Literacy-Step-3.jpg","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":345,"bigWidth":"728","bigHeight":"546","licensing":" div class=\"mw-parser-output\" p License: a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/\" Creative Commons \/a br \n \/p p br \/ \n \/p \/div "}</span> 3 <b> Explain the difference between a need and a want.</b> Tell your learner that housing, utilities, and other core bills are spending priorities. If money’s tight, paying rent or car insurance is more important than going out to eat or buying a new cell phone. [3] <span> <span> X</span> <span> Research source</span> <span> </span> </span> Subtract their expenses from income, and discuss how balancing needs and wants impacts their budget. Ask them to identify needs that take priority and wants that can be cut to save money. <span> {"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/2\/25\/Teach-Financial-Literacy-Step-4.jpg\/v4-460px-Teach-Financial-Literacy-Step-4.jpg","bigUrl":"\/images\/thumb\/2\/25\/Teach-Financial-Literacy-Step-4.jpg\/aid9668898-v4-728px-Teach-Financial-Literacy-Step-4.jpg","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":345,"bigWidth":"728","bigHeight":"546","licensing":" div class=\"mw-parser-output\" p License: a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/\" Creative Commons \/a br \n \/p p br \/ \n \/p \/div "}</span> 4 <b> Show them how to make bill payments.</b> Mention that the most common ways to pay bills are via check or debit. Show them a physical check and explain how to fill in the date, payee, payment amount, and signature fields. Then go to an online bill payment portal and explain how to fill in debit card billing information.

Let them know that saving 10 to 20 percent of their income is crucial, and they’ll need to save more of their income as they get older. [5] <span> <span> X</span> <span> Research source</span> <span> </span> </span> Include specific reasons to save, such as for an emergency, a down payment on a home, and retirement. You can also teach them to create different savings to help them save for multiple goals.

Personal finance simulators can provide accessible, concrete examples and reinforce budget management skills.

Tell them that if they don’t repay a line of credit, they’ll have a harder time getting leases, mortgages, cars, jobs, and other life essentials. [8] <span> <span> X</span> <span> Research source</span> <span> </span> </span> Understanding credit is an important first step towards financial literacy. If the person already has some debt, you can also help them come up with a basic payment plan for handling that debt.

Mention that the better credit you have, the lower your interest rate will be on credit cards, mortgages, and car loans. Explain that interest on a loan can capitalize if it’s not paid, which is when it becomes part of the principle, or original loan amount. [10] <span> <span> X</span> <span> Research source</span> <span> </span> </span> Compare a credit balance with library books to help them understand. If they return the book they borrowed, they won’t have to pay extra. If they keep the book past its due date, they’ll have to pay extra, or interest.

Explain that the score is based on payment history, amounts owed, length of credit history, new credit and recently opened accounts, and types of credit in use. Stress that a low number will negatively impact their ability to get loans, leases, jobs, and other necessities.

Tell them they can’t use the card to make a purchase they can’t afford. Remind them of the library book analogy to stress the importance of paying of a balance by the due date. [13] <span> <span> X</span> <span> Research source</span> <span> </span> </span> Mention that if they don’t pay off a balance and credit card debt piles up, their credit score will take a major hit.

Let them know that there are risks, but investments are a good way to grow money for retirement. Explain that there are a variety of ways to invest money, and go over the basic types of investments. [17] <span> <span> X</span> <span> Research source</span> <span> </span> </span> Stocks are when you purchase a small amount of ownership in a company. If the company performs well, your investment becomes more valuable. Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are pools of money from lots of investors that are used to purchase a diverse range of investments. Since they hold dozens or hundreds of securities, or investments, they’re less risky than purchasing stock in a single company. Bonds are when you lend money to a government or a business for a specific length of time at a fixed interest rate. While they’re lower risk, bond earnings are lower-yield investments. <span> {"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/c\/c8\/Teach-Financial-Literacy-Step-14.jpg\/v4-460px-Teach-Financial-Literacy-Step-14.jpg","bigUrl":"\/images\/thumb\/c\/c8\/Teach-Financial-Literacy-Step-14.jpg\/aid9668898-v4-728px-Teach-Financial-Literacy-Step-14.jpg","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":345,"bigWidth":"728","bigHeight":"546","licensing":" div class=\"mw-parser-output\" p License: a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/\" Creative Commons \/a br \n \/p p br \/ \n \/p \/div "}</span> 4 <b> Discuss risk and diversification.</b> After introducing basic types of investments, tell your learner that each has a degree of risk. If they invest in 1 company that goes under, their investment will lose value. In order to lower their risk, they need to diversify, or invest in many companies and other investment categories (such as natural resources or real estate).
